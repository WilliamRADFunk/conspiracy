# ~~~ Synopsis ~~~
The Cabal Effect is an application originally conceived as an idea for a Hackathon. 
Its purpose is to provide a social playground for users to submit ideas for conspiracies while 
attempting to support their claims with use of text and media. This environment essentially becomes 
the conspiracy lounge for all to build elaborate concepts, which can be done by linking evidence from 
others conspiracies to create an endless database of incriminating evidence to support the user’s claims. 
People can then proceed to discuss with the creator and followers of a conspiracy within segmented threads
 where people can judge the evidence of the creator and provide counter claims or supporting material. 

# ~~~ Motivation ~~~
The motivation of this project was to provide a hub of communication for people who love and enjoy gossiping 
about life. Coming up with theories, both satirical and factual, generates an environment where users can express
opinions which cultivates ideas. This creates a platform where information of past and current events can be 
discussed in a manner that people would find engaging. 

# ~~~ Goals ~~~
-	Learn and Implement Parse infrastructure for application development. 
-	Successfully start and finish a working prototype of an application for Hackathon
-	Create a social platform for users to voice opinions over theories.
-	Strengthen up on database concepts and front-end development implementation
