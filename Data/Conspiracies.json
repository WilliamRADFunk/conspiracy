        "description": "UCF was secretly the creator of the concept for Disney World. Have you ever wondered why Disney is off the charts with all of its property that it currently owns? There is no way that one organization alone managed to come up with all the ideas that it has throughout the years without having outsourced any of the projects that were necessary. This is why I am suggesting that UCF is actually responsible for the large success for Disney as a whole. It’s not just all the internships that Disney siphons off of their parent company, UCF, but all the projects it has us do. LOL we basically made SPACE MOUNTAIN for them. I mean it couldn’t be less obvious. Clearly the display at UCF’s Engineering 2 building is an apparent example of Disney World wanting to extend part of their park into the schools landscape. I mean if we were just showing off the cart that was designed by UCF students, wouldn’t we have just displayed the cart alone? The tracks are connected underground to a still present track system that most likely would have joined both UCF and Disney World together. Of course, planners realized that this would most likely botch their cover, and so they went against this decision and conveniently covered up their mid construction with a statue commemorating our students.",

Of course he used his own death to make a lot of money. Bet he's riding nice coffin. Anyhow, luv ya BOWIE but i caught you red handed.  ",

This is because Microsoft is using a lot of \"fine-print\" logic to try and stifle our voice and forcing this plague upon us. They are essentially forcing us to be their lab rats, whether we want to or not. And dont even get me started with their infinite data collection scheme.

I swear this drug is getting me so crazy for pennies that I have coin rolls installed on my toilet in such a way that I can fill those up with each seating. I can’t help myself. The only time I find myself able to wane myself off the addiction is when I stop by 24 hour Viagra binge so that I can perform my husbandly duties. Please I need help.

And what better way than gaining almost unlimited access to the youth community? Well this is where Minecraft comes into play. Minecraft is conditioning the younger generations into a world that will ultimately be controlled by Microsoft. Why do you think Microsoft is pushing out this Windows 10 update so ferociously? They want all that free data collection to make a completed report filing of their enemy. They want to know all of our secrets, are fears and weakness, as well as our strength, so they can train the children to fight against these points so that when it comes time to start the process, they already have all the diamond swords and potions that they need to make it possible to take us down!

Sure this all seems like fun and games, and that they are doing an amazing thing. But really, how is no one seeing what is actually going to transpire if we don’t garner ourselves in a collaborate effort to push away these oppressors. They are looking for GLOBAL DOMINATION. AND I KNOW what you’re thinking. \"Oh, they may just be trying to secure the global market for internet to collect more data and stuff.\" WELL THAT’S FAR FROM THE TRUTH. Have you actually seen what’s inside these airships they are lazily flying around to provide WIFI??? They are transporting cargo of great importance to their plans. Specifically placed and calculated EMP pulses will turn the world into a unorganized mess and where will everyone go for their internet provisions? Google is just going to sit on top of their thrones and send out their Android army built by all that data they have collected on all of us and we won’t be able to post anything on snapchat about how my neighbor is being attacked by funny looking green robots. Who will save Mrs. Harrison? Well definitely not anyone. Google will sit back and reap all the benefits",

They are trying to cover up external communications with a barrier outside our realm of reality. Ever since the first trip to space, they realized that the infinite universe was an illusion and that we are just stuck in our own little sphere. Right outside of our planets horizon exists a plane where the government is interacting with the creators, making agreements and organizing our fate.

Dead Rising was way ahead of its day, bringing the idea that the United States Government would resort to mutating the human genome in order to find a viable method to grow cattle at an exponential rate. Taco Bell is no exception from that rule. Have you ever wondered where the homeless that gather around fast-food joints go? Well I bet Taco Bell does! “Yum!” is a company that is essentially the parent company of all these different fast food joints. I believe that “Yum!” is using its child company Taco Bell to test this new process of using cannibalism to feed off a part of their market. I swear, too many times I find myself circling a Taco Bell just to see that homeless dude disappear around a corner and never come back. I mean face the facts!!! Do you really think that beef is the cause of all our indigestion problems and late night bathroom issues? I mean you must be a fool to serve this cannibalistic food at conventions, let alone for your family dinner.

Its win-win really. It’s just finding that specific place where it exists and playing with it until it produces the results that we want. It’s just so hidden. It was purposely hidden so carefully by its makers because knowing the G-spot location and what to do with it really provides power to the user. Essentially I have managed to find that G-Spot on the new GeForce “GTX Titan X” graphics card. All I have to figure out now is how to unlock that extra processing power only meant to be known by the developers of the chip.

UCF is purposely abandoning cars on the lower levels of the parking garages in order to create more issues for parking for their students. The reason??? Well they want to make sure that their students never graduate college! I swear this is the third time that I have had to take MACRO economics. They fill up the spots to make it harder to park, and therefore you keep making it to all your classes late. When this happens, teachers begin failing you on your exams because you couldn’t make it to class. Well it wasn’t my fault I lost those precious 30 minutes of class because I was stuck in parking garage D trying to find room on the ledge of the top floor. Need evidence??? Well look no further than Parking Garage A. Why are there so many cars parked their at night? It makes no sense, who is even in school at this time. These are some of their left over cars from their daily routine of parking congestion that they leave here. I’m going to the deans tomorrow about this. If you don’t hear from me after that, assume that I died and report this to the police. (Watch out, I think the police may be involved so proceed with caution)",
